  Nersent-ui is a beautiful material design framework which is on `React` for building interface using components and `styled-components` for styling. We try to reproduce components from Android as much as we can.

# Warning
Due to new version of `Material Design`, we will rewrite `nersent-ui` in few months.

## Installing
To install our framework just run in terminal:
```
npm install nersent-ui
```

## Documentation
Currently, there is no documentation.
