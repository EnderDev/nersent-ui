# nersent-ui
Nersent-ui is a beautiful [`Material Design`](https://nodejs.org/en/) framework. We use use `React` for building interface and for styling `Styled-Components`. The framework has very similar animations to Material Design in Android Nougat. We are trying to create the best looking and working components as we can.

## Installing
To install our framework just run in terminal:
```
npm install nersent-ui
```

## Documentation
Guides how to use our components are located in [`docs`](docs).
